#Demo about class vs instance variables and methods

#instance methods and variables
class Robot
	#has a type
	#can puts it type
end

#Now add a class method, using Robot

#new keyword: self
#self refers to the class inside a class definition
#self refers to an instance inside a method definition

#Demonstrate using class method
#You can't use a class method on an instance (or an instance method on a class)


#Now add a class variable, hive_mind_activated
#show writing getters and setters

#Demonstrate using class variable

#write attack instance method that uses class variable
